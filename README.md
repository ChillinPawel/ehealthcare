# ehealthcare
E-Healthcare system project
This is my first standalone Spring Boot project using Maven. It is still in the early stage of development.

This should be a simple content management site, where users can register and log in. 

Users will be split to Patients, Doctors and Admin, each having common and unique features.

Doctors will create Visits, which in turn may be booked by a patient. Each doctor will have his own set of Visits for patient to choose from.

Admin as the name states will be in charge of manual account management including (un)blocking the user, restoring his/her password and banning the user from portal usage.
